JSTwitter
=========
This is my work through of the [Jumpstart Labs](http://jumpstartlab.com/)
Ruby exericse [JSTwitter](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown).

The approach I am taking for this is to try some BDD using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)
and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
